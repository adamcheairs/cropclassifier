# CropClassifier

CropClassifier is a deep learning model I created for potato plant disease detection. It can accurately classify potato plant images as either healthy or unhealthy, aiding in the early detection and management of crop diseases. The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 97% after training for 10 epochs.

## Usage Examples

To use the CropClassifier, follow these steps:

1. Load the trained model:
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

   model = load_model('crop_classifier_model.h5')
   ```

2. Preprocess an image for prediction:
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
   import numpy as np

   img_path = 'path/to/image.jpg'
   img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(256, 256))
   img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
   img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
   preprocessed_img = img_array / 255.0
   ```

3. Make a prediction:
   ```python
   prediction = model.predict(preprocessed_img)
   if prediction[0][0] > 0.5:
       print("Unhealthy plant")
   else:
       print("Healthy plant")
   ```

## Results and Evaluation

The CropClassifier achieved a remarkable accuracy of 97% in identifying healthy and unhealthy plants. This accuracy indicates the model's ability to accurately classify plant images and distinguish between healthy and diseased potato crops. In addition to accuracy, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score were evaluated to assess the model's performance comprehensively.
